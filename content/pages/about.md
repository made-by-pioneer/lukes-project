  Title = "Luke’s Legacy"
  Paragraph = "Luke was a kid who loved people. Outwardly he may have seemed like a normal teenager, but inside was another story. Luke had an enormous heart and a calling to serve others. He created friends wherever he went and he wanted to leave places better than they were when he arrived. During Luke’s short 20 years on this earth, he was able to touch and change countless people’s lives through acts of service. From mission trips and volunteering his time, to working at his local church and pumping thousands of people’s gas at his college job, Luke thought of others before thinking of himself."
