[scholarship_for_clubs]
Paragraph = "This arm of our organization is suited for student organizations or clubs. LP11 offers a grant up to $1,100.00 as “seed” funds for projects needed in our community. It can be used in any way the group deems necessary to accomplish the task. The total amount may be enough to cover all of the needs to fulfill the project or the group may need to create a way to use part of their funds to raise more to complete the overall project."
Read_More = "Not only do we offer the funding, but we also offer to be a resource that can be used to put people together who can help, as well as offering “hands on” labor if needed. At the conclusion of the project, the participants will share how this act of service benefited the lives of others and how it impacted their own lives. We will then AWARD the group an additional monetary donation in the amount that was originally asked (for example, Club ABC was given $600 to complete their project. After successfully completing it, the club was awarded $600 to go towards their club). The funds awarded in the end can be used for anything at all—they can put it toward a future service project or make purchases that will help their organization to be better or more efficient, etc."

[service_award]
Paragraph = "Graduating high school seniors have the opportunity to apply for a $2,000 Scholarship to the secondary education institution of their choice. There are no GPA requirements, as this scholarship is based solely on the character of the student as revealed through their life and service to others. How it works: Each high school will have one service award. The Service Award winner from each participating high school is then placed into a pool where all applications are read and studied to determine who has shown the greatest amount of “Self-LESS” service. The student that rises to the top will be awarded a $2,000 scholarship."
